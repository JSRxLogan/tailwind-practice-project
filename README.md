# Tailwind CSS Practice

This repository contains two small projects where I applied **Tailwind CSS** to practice styling:

1. **Responsive Card**: A card layout built using Tailwind CSS to showcase responsive design.
2. **Static Website**: A simple static page built with Tailwind, demonstrating its utility-first design approach.

## Why Tailwind?

While learning **React** from a YouTube series, I was advised not to focus on styling at first, as all the required **Tailwind CSS** classes would be provided. But as I progressed and began using **conditional Tailwind** in React, I realized I needed to understand **Tailwind** better to fully utilize it in my React projects. 

This prompted me to dive deeper into **Tailwind CSS**, and I applied it here in these practice projects to enhance my understanding and get hands-on experience.

## What's Next?

After building these practice projects, I used what I learned to style my **React To-Do App** (coming soon on my GitHub). The combination of **React** and **Tailwind CSS** made my development process more efficient and clean.
