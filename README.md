## 🔥 Why Tailwind? My React Epiphany
During my React learning journey:  
1. **Early Days**: Focused purely on functionality - styling came pre-packaged  
2. **The Turning Point**:  
   - Hit roadblocks with **conditional Tailwind classes** in React  
   - Realized I was just copying classes without understanding  
3. **This Project**:  
   - Deep-dived into Tailwind with Hitesh sir's lectures to **truly own my React styling**  
   - Practiced utility combinations to **plan future React projects confidently**  

> *"Tailwind mastery unlocked my ability to design React components intentionally, not accidentally."*
